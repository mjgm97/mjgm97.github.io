        title: "A Systematic Literature Review of Game-based Assessment Studies: Trends and Challenges",
        authors: "Manuel J. Gomez, José A. Ruipérez-Valiente & Félix J. García Clemente",
        abstract: "Technology has become an essential part of our everyday life, and its use in educational environments keeps growing. In addition, games are one of the most popular activities across cultures and ages, and there is ample evidence that supports the benefits of using games for assessment. This field is commonly known as game-based assessment (GBA), which refers to the use of games to assess learners' competencies, skills, or knowledge. This paper analyzes the current status of the GBA field by performing the first systematic literature review on empirical GBA studies. It is based on 65 research papers that used digital GBAs to determine: (1) the context where the study has been applied; (2) the primary purpose; (3) the domain of the game used; (4) game/tool availability; (5) the size of the data sample; (6) the computational methods and algorithms applied; (7) the targeted stakeholders of the study; and (8) what limitations and challenges are reported by authors. Based on the categories established and our analysis, the findings suggest that GBAs are mainly used in K-16 education and for assessment purposes, and that most GBAs focus on assessing STEM content, and cognitive and soft skills. Furthermore, the current limitations indicate that future GBA research would benefit from the use of bigger data samples and more specialized algorithms. Based on our results, we discuss current trends in the field and open challenges (including replication and validation problems), providing recommendations for the future research agenda of the GBA field.",

        title: "Developing and validating interoperable ontology-driven game-based assessments",
        authors: "Manuel J. Gomez, José A. Ruipérez-Valiente & Félix J. García Clemente",
        abstract: "Video games have assumed an important place in our daily lives. This has led to an increasing interest on the use of games for non-entertainment purposes, introducing the concept of Serious Games (SGs). In particular, SGs are being explored because of their potential to provide reliable assessments, but also because they can measure competences that would be difficult to measure using traditional forms of assessment. However, one of the key issues is that assessment machinery has to be designed specifically for each game, increasing the time and effort when designing and implementing Game-Based Assessments (GBAs). In this research, we introduce a novel approach to develop interoperable GBAs by: (1) designing and creating an ontology that can standardize the GBA area; (2) conducting a validation study on literature metrics to replicate them and designing novel metrics using data from different SGs; (3) conducting a case study that illustrates how our approach can be used in a real life scenario with real data. Our results confirm that the designed ontology can be used to effectively perform GBAs, along with the metrics replicated and designed in the system. We expect our work to solve the current limitations regarding GBA interoperability, thus allowing the deployment of Game-Based Assessments as a Service (GBAaaS).",

        authors: "Manuel J. Gomez, José A. Ruipérez-Valiente & Félix J. García Clemente",
        abstract: "During the last few years, there has been increasing attention paid to serious games (SGs), which are games used for non-entertainment purposes. SGs offer the potential for more valid and reliable assessments compared to traditional methods such as paper-and-pencil tests. However, the incorporation of assessment features into SGs is still in its early stages, requiring specific design efforts for each game and adding significant time to the design of Game-based Assessments (GBAs). In this research, we present a completely novel framework that aims to perform interoperable GBAs by: (a) integrating a common GBA ontology model to process RDF data; (b) developing in-game metrics to infer useful information and assess learners; (c) integrating a service API to provide an easy way to interact with the framework. We then validate our approach through performance evaluation and two use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios with large-scale datasets. Our results show that the developed framework achieves excellent performance, replicating metrics from previous literature. We anticipate that our work will help alleviate current limitations in the field and facilitate the deployment of GBAs as a Service.",

        authors: "Manuel J. Gomez, Armada Sánchez, A., Mariano Albaladejo-González, José A. Ruipérez-Valiente & Félix J. García Clemente",
        abstract: "In recent years, serious games (SGs) have emerged as a powerful tool in education by combining pedagogy and entertainment, facilitating the acquisition of knowledge and skills in engaging environments. SGs enable the collection of valuable interaction data from students, allowing for the analysis of student performance, with artificial intelligence (AI) playing a key role in processing this data to make informed inferences about their knowledge and skills. However, the lack of explainability in AI models represents a significant challenge. This research aims to develop an interpretable model for predicting students' performance in real-time while playing an SG by: (1) calculating the performance of an interpretable prediction model of task completion in an SG and (2) demonstrating the application of the interpretable model for just-in-time (JIT) classroom interventions. Our results show that we are able to predict students' task completion in real-time with a balanced accuracy result of 77.21% after a short playtime has elapsed. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach has been applied to ensure the interpretability of the developed models. This approach supports personalised learning experiences, unlocks AI benefits for non-technical users, and maintains transparency in education.",

        abstract:"In this research, we introduce a novel open-source labeling tool, the Game-Based Assessment (GBA) Labeling Tool, specifically designed to address current challenges for data labeling in GBA scenarios. This web-based application facilitates the annotation of audio, video, and game event data, offering three different types of annotations – global, time instant, and time window annotations – to enhance accuracy in the labeling process.
