        authors: "Manuel J. Gomez, Mariano Albaladejo-González, Félix J. García Clemente & José A. Ruipérez-Valiente",
        abstract: "Serious Games (SGs) have gained attention as powerful educational tools because of their potential to provide reliable assessments and evaluate hard-to-measure constructs and competencies that are difficult to capture using traditional forms of assessment. Specifically, this study presents a human-centered approach to model and detect persistence — a key component of successful learning outcomes — in the context of SGs. With this purpose in mind, we developed a comprehensive rubric to characterize persistence behaviors in SGs. To design the rubric, we identified a set of persistence profiles and characteristics from previous literature and elaborated a general rubric for identifying persistence behaviors at the level of individual attempts. These characteristics were then mapped onto measurable features within Shadowspect, the SG used for data collection. Following this rubric, two annotators manually labeled 1,374 level attempts from 64 students using two visualization methods: in-game and text replays. With a comprehensive dataset of 2,748 labeled attempts, we trained and evaluated Machine Learning (ML) models for each type of replay to classify persistence behaviors across four categories: Persistence, Non-persistence, Unproductive persistence, and No behavior. Our results indicate that while text-based replays enable efficient annotation with promising performance, in-game replays may provide finer detail for certain complex behaviors, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each visualization method. This work contributes the use of SGs for assessment, illustrating a transparent and adaptable AI-driven approach that enhances reliability and user-centered insights, highlighting the complementary role of human input in optimizing AI-based models to achieve meaningful, user-centered assessments in education.",

        abstract: "Creativity is often characterized by the capacity to generate novel ideas, explore unconventional approaches, and solve problems through intuition, curiosity, and innovative thinking. Assessing this multifaceted skill is both essential and challenging, especially in educational and game-based environments where creativity drives engagement and learning. In this study, we expanded upon existing research on creativity measurements in digital games to propose a comprehensive model for identifying creative solutions in serious digital puzzle games. This model was adapted to a geometry-focused puzzle game, with solutions manually evaluated across dimensions such as fluency, flexibility, and surprise. Using the resulting labelled dataset, we trained machine learning models to classify creative solutions, achieving promising results. These findings highlight the potential for integrated methods to advance creativity assessment and enhance educational game design, contributing to the development of tools that inspire and nurture creative thinking in learners.",

        abstract: "Block-based programming environments, such as Scratch and StarLogo Nova, are popular in STEM education for introducing algorithmic thinking to non-technical users. However, capturing and understanding students' interactions with these environments in real-time is challenging for educators, limiting their ability to provide effective feedback and support. In this research, we developed an integrated replay system within StarLogo Nova that records and replays student interactions, providing teachers with the ability to review and reflect on these interactions in detail. Additionally, the system also includes analytics features that help educators summarize user interactions and identify key moments, offering perspectives that go beyond what a standard screen capture can provide. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of the system to assess its accuracy in capturing user interactions, confirming its effectiveness for educators in analyzing student behavior. The results are promising, showing improved analytics and a 99.65% reduction in file size compared to traditional screen capture.",

        authors: "Manuel J. Gomez, Armada Sánchez, A., Mariano Albaladejo-González, José A. Ruipérez-Valiente & Félix J. García Clemente",
        abstract: "In recent years, serious games (SGs) have emerged as a powerful tool in education by combining pedagogy and entertainment, facilitating the acquisition of knowledge and skills in engaging environments. SGs enable the collection of valuable interaction data from students, allowing for the analysis of student performance, with artificial intelligence (AI) playing a key role in processing this data to make informed inferences about their knowledge and skills. However, the lack of explainability in AI models represents a significant challenge. This research aims to develop an interpretable model for predicting students' performance in real-time while playing an SG by: (1) calculating the performance of an interpretable prediction model of task completion in an SG and (2) demonstrating the application of the interpretable model for just-in-time (JIT) classroom interventions. Our results show that we are able to predict students' task completion in real-time with a balanced accuracy result of 77.21% after a short playtime has elapsed. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach has been applied to ensure the interpretability of the developed models. This approach supports personalised learning experiences, unlocks AI benefits for non-technical users, and maintains transparency in education.",

        authors: "Manuel J. Gomez, José A. Ruipérez-Valiente & Félix J. García Clemente",
        abstract: "Video games have assumed an important place in our daily lives. This has led to an increasing interest on the use of games for non-entertainment purposes, introducing the concept of Serious Games (SGs). In particular, SGs are being explored because of their potential to provide reliable assessments, but also because they can measure competences that would be difficult to measure using traditional forms of assessment. However, one of the key issues is that assessment machinery has to be designed specifically for each game, increasing the time and effort when designing and implementing Game-Based Assessments (GBAs). In this research, we introduce a novel approach to develop interoperable GBAs by: (1) designing and creating an ontology that can standardize the GBA area; (2) conducting a validation study on literature metrics to replicate them and designing novel metrics using data from different SGs; (3) conducting a case study that illustrates how our approach can be used in a real life scenario with real data. Our results confirm that the designed ontology can be used to effectively perform GBAs, along with the metrics replicated and designed in the system. We expect our work to solve the current limitations regarding GBA interoperability, thus allowing the deployment of Game-Based Assessments as a Service (GBAaaS).",

        authors: "Manuel J. Gomez, José A. Ruipérez-Valiente & Félix J. García Clemente",
        abstract: "During the last few years, there has been increasing attention paid to serious games (SGs), which are games used for non-entertainment purposes. SGs offer the potential for more valid and reliable assessments compared to traditional methods such as paper-and-pencil tests. However, the incorporation of assessment features into SGs is still in its early stages, requiring specific design efforts for each game and adding significant time to the design of Game-based Assessments (GBAs). In this research, we present a completely novel framework that aims to perform interoperable GBAs by: (a) integrating a common GBA ontology model to process RDF data; (b) developing in-game metrics to infer useful information and assess learners; (c) integrating a service API to provide an easy way to interact with the framework. We then validate our approach through performance evaluation and two use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios with large-scale datasets. Our results show that the developed framework achieves excellent performance, replicating metrics from previous literature. We anticipate that our work will help alleviate current limitations in the field and facilitate the deployment of GBAs as a Service.",

        authors: "Manuel J. Gomez, José A. Ruipérez-Valiente & Félix J. García Clemente",
        abstract: "Over the last decade, there has been a large amount of research on technology-enhanced learning (TEL), including the exploration of sensor-based technologies. This research area has seen significant contributions from various conferences, including the European Conference on Technology-Enhanced Learning (EC-TEL). In this research, we present a comprehensive analysis that aims to identify and understand the evolving topics in the TEL area and their implications in defining the future of education. To achieve this, we use a novel methodology that combines a text-analytics-driven topic analysis and a social network analysis following an open science approach. We collected a comprehensive corpus of 477 papers from the last decade of the EC-TEL conference (including full and short papers), parsed them automatically, and used the extracted text to find the main topics and collaborative networks across papers. Our analysis focused on the following three main objectives: (1) Discovering the main topics of the conference based on paper keywords and topic modeling using the full text of the manuscripts. (2) Discovering the evolution of said topics over the last ten years of the conference. (3) Discovering how papers and authors from the conference have interacted over the years from a network perspective. Specifically, we used Python and PdfToText library to parse and extract the text and author keywords from the corpus. Moreover, we employed Gensim library Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to discover the primary topics from the last decade. Finally, Gephi and Networkx libraries were used to create co-authorship and citation networks. Our findings provide valuable insights into the latest trends and developments in educational technology, underlining the critical role of sensor-driven technologies in leading innovation and shaping the future of this area.",

        authors: "Manuel J. Gomez, José A. Ruipérez-Valiente & Félix J. García Clemente",
        abstract: "Technology has become an essential part of our everyday life, and its use in educational environments keeps growing. In addition, games are one of the most popular activities across cultures and ages, and there is ample evidence that supports the benefits of using games for assessment. This field is commonly known as game-based assessment (GBA), which refers to the use of games to assess learners' competencies, skills, or knowledge. This paper analyzes the current status of the GBA field by performing the first systematic literature review on empirical GBA studies. It is based on 65 research papers that used digital GBAs to determine: (1) the context where the study has been applied; (2) the primary purpose; (3) the domain of the game used; (4) game/tool availability; (5) the size of the data sample; (6) the computational methods and algorithms applied; (7) the targeted stakeholders of the study; and (8) what limitations and challenges are reported by authors. Based on the categories established and our analysis, the findings suggest that GBAs are mainly used in K-16 education and for assessment purposes, and that most GBAs focus on assessing STEM content, and cognitive and soft skills. Furthermore, the current limitations indicate that future GBA research would benefit from the use of bigger data samples and more specialized algorithms. Based on our results, we discuss current trends in the field and open challenges (including replication and validation problems), providing recommendations for the future research agenda of the GBA field.",

        abstract: "The recent pandemic has changed the way we see education. During recent years, Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) providers, such as Coursera or edX, are reporting millions of new users signing up on their platforms. Though online review systems are standard among many verticals, no standardized or fully decentralized review systems exist in the MOOC ecosystem. In this vein, we believe that there is an opportunity to leverage available open MOOC reviews in order to build simpler and more transparent reviewing systems, allowing users to really identify the best courses out there. Specifically, in our research we analyze 2.4 million reviews (which is the largest MOOC reviews dataset used until now) from five different platforms in order to determine the following: (1) if the numeric ratings provide discriminant information to learners, (2) if NLP-driven sentiment analysis on textual reviews could provide valuable information to learners, (3) if we can leverage NLP-driven topic finding techniques to infer themes that could be important for learners, and (4) if we can use these models to effectively characterize MOOCs based on the open reviews. Results show that numeric ratings are clearly biased (63% of them are 5-star ratings), and the topic modeling reveals some interesting topics related with course advertisements, the real applicability, or the difficulty of the different courses.",

        abstract: "Nowadays, the use of technology in continuously increasing, making a significant impact in almost every area, including education. New areas have gained much popularity in the last years in educational technology (EdTech), such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) or computer-supported collaborative learning. In addition, research and interest in this area have also been growing over the years. The quantity of research and scientific publications in EdTech is constantly increasing, and trying to analyze and extract information from a set of research papers is often a very time-consuming task. To make this process easier and solve these limitations, we present Fontana , a framework that can quickly perform trend and social network analysis using any corpus of documents and its metadata. Specifically, the framework can: 1) Discover the latest trends given any corpus of documents, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis and keywords (bibliometric approach); 2) Discover the evolution of the trends previously identified over the years; 3) Discover the primary authors and papers, along with hidden relationships between existing communities. To test its functionality, we evaluated the framework using a corpus of papers from the EdTech research field. We also followed an open science methodology making the entire framework available in Open Science Framework (OSF) easy to access and use. The case study successfully proved the capabilities of the framework, revealing some of the most frequent topics in the area, such as “EDM,” “learning analytics,” or “collaborative learning.” We expect our work to help identifying trends and patterns in the EdTech area, using natural language processing and social network analysis to objectively process large amounts of research.",

However, incorporating game activities as part of the curriculum in schools remains limited. Some of the barriers for broader adoption in classrooms is the lack of actionable assessment data, the fact that teachers often do not have a clear sense of how students are interacting with the game, and it is unclear if the gameplay is leading to productive learning. To address this gap, we seek to provide sequence and process mining metrics to teachers that are easily interpretable and actionable. More specifically, we build our work on top of Shadowspect, a three-dimensional geometry game that has been developed to measure geometry skills as well other cognitive and noncognitive skills. We use data from its implementation across schools in the U.S. to implement two sequence and process mining metrics in an interactive dashboard for teachers. The final objective is to facilitate that teachers can understand the sequence of actions and common errors of students using Shadowspect so they can better understand the process, make proper assessment, and conduct personalized interventions when appropriate.",

However, we do not usually find educational games within the classroom activities.

To support teachers, educational games should incorporate learning analytics to transform data generated by students when playing useful information in a friendly and understandable way. For this work, we build upon Shadowspect , a 3D geometry puzzle game that has been used by teachers in a group of schools in the US. We use learning analytics techniques to generate a set of metrics implemented in a live dashboard that aims to facilitate that teachers can understand students’ interaction with Shadowspect . We depict the multidisciplinary design process that we have followed to generate the metrics and the dashboard with great detail. Finally, we also provide uses cases that exemplify how teachers can use the dashboard to understand the global progress of their class and each of their students at an individual level, in order to intervene, adapt their classes and provide personalize feedback when appropriate.",

In this study we use a data collection from our game Shadowspect and implement learning analytics with process and sequence mining techniques to generate two metrics that aim to help teachers make proper assessment and better understand the process.",

        abstract: "Video games have become one of the most popular mediums across cultures and ages. There is ample evidence that supports the benefits of using games for learning and assessment, and educators are largely supportive of using games in classrooms. However, the implementation of educational games as part of the curriculum and classroom practices has been rather scarce. One of the main barriers is that teachers face to actually know how their students are using the game so that they can analyze properly the effect of the activity and the interaction of students. Therefore, to support teachers to fully leverage the potential benefits of games in classrooms and make data-based decisions, educational games should incorporate learning analytics by transforming click-stream data generated from the gameplay into meaningful metrics and present visualizations of those metrics so that teachers can receive the information in an interactive and friendly way. For this work, we use data collected in a case study where teachers used Shadowspect geometry puzzle games in their classrooms. We apply learning analytics techniques to generate a series of metrics and visualizations that seek to facilitate that teachers can understand the interaction of students with the game. In this way, teachers can be more aware of the global progress of the class and each one of their students at an individual level, and intervene and adapt their classes when necessary.",
