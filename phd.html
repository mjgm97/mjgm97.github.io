                                        As the 21st century progresses, new assessment methodologies are emerging and
                                        challenging traditional approaches for evaluating knowledge, skills, and
                                        behaviors. Game-Based Assessment (GBA) has been gaining increasing attention in
                                        recent years due to its potential to enhance current assessment practices. GBAs
                                        have been proved to be robust alternatives to conventional forms of assessment
                                        such as paper-and-pencil tests.

                                        <p>
                                            Given this potential to transform traditional assessment practices, the main
                                            purpose of this Ph.D. thesis is to explore and develop methodological and
                                            technical approaches for delivering valid, meaningful, and adaptive
                                            assessment experiences. Specifically, this dissertation poses five
                                            objectives: the first objective proposes a comprehensive examination and
                                            evaluation of GBA field, particularly with the recent rise in the popularity
                                            of games and digital learning. The second objective of this Ph.D. thesis
                                            focuses on designing and developing an interoperable semantic model for log
                                            data. Then, the third objective is geared towards the creation of an
                                            efficient architecture capable of performing GBAs at scale. The fourth
                                            proposed objective aims to enhance student performance prediction by using
                                            Explainable AI (XAI). Last but not least, the fifth objective of this thesis
                                            seeks to optimize the data labeling process for AI techniques in the GBA
                                            domain through the creation of a practical tool.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            To achieve the proposed objectives, a clearly structured methodology was
                                            followed. Firstly, a systematic review of 65 recent studies in the GBA field
                                            addresses the first objective, facilitating the identification of current
                                            trends, commonly used methodologies, and potential gaps in the literature.
                                            Secondly, to address the interoperability issue identified in the review, we
                                            designed and implemented an ontology-driven model for standardizing various
                                            log data formats from different games. Then, a formal evaluation and
                                            real-world testing were conducted, therefore fulfilling the second
                                            objective. Thirdly, to provide a scalable architecture in which the ontology
                                            model could be integrated, an interoperable framework was developed using an
                                            open-source structured data processing engine as the basis to enable
                                            computation over large-scale datasets. The next step of the methodology
                                            fulfills the fourth objective and involved the development of a learner
                                            performance prediction model for a SG using Machine Learning (ML)
                                            techniques, incorporating XAI techniques to ensure model explainability.
                                            Finally, the fifth step of the methodology consisted of developing a
                                            practical tool specifically designed for labeling various types of GBA data,
                                            with support for audio, video, and game-event inputs.
                                        </p>

                                            As main conclusions, this Ph.D. thesis underlines the value and potential of
                                            GBA for education and training. Although we have seen that valuable
                                            knowledge can be extracted from user interaction data, there remains a need
                                            for more standardized assessment frameworks, as the current specificity
                                            limits the replication of experiments and the transferability of results
                                            into practice. Moreover, the conducted review also revealed the importance
                                            of making good game designs instead of relying on vague implementations,
                                            such as embedding hidden questionnaires within the gameplay. Finally, it is
                                            also worth mentioning the need for more sophisticated assessment methods to
                                            appropriately capture the complexity and context-dependence nature of
                                            certain skills and behaviors.

                                            <p>Technology has become an essential part of our everyday life, and its
                                                use
                                                in educational environments keeps growing. In addition, games are
                                                one of
                                                the most popular activities across cultures and ages, and there is
                                                ample
                                                evidence that supports the benefits of using games for assessment.
                                                This
                                                field is commonly known as game-based assessment (GBA), which refers
                                                to
                                                the use of games to assess learners' competencies, skills, or
                                                knowledge.
                                                This paper analyzes the current status of the GBA field by
                                                performing
                                                the first systematic literature review on empirical GBA studies. It
                                                is
                                                based on 65 research papers that used digital GBAs to determine: (1)
                                                the
                                                context where the study has been applied; (2) the primary purpose;
                                                (3)
                                                the domain of the game used; (4) game/tool availability; (5) the
                                                size of
                                                the data sample; (6) the computational methods and algorithms
                                                applied;
                                                (7) the targeted stakeholders of the study; and (8) what limitations
                                                and
                                                challenges are reported by authors. Based on the categories
                                                established
                                                and our analysis, the findings suggest that GBAs are mainly used in
                                                K-16
                                                education and for assessment purposes, and that most GBAs focus on
                                                assessing STEM content, and cognitive and soft skills. Furthermore,
                                                the
                                                current limitations indicate that future GBA research would benefit
                                                from
                                                the use of bigger data samples and more specialized algorithms.
                                                Based on
                                                our results, we discuss current trends in the field and open
                                                challenges
                                                (including replication and validation problems), providing
                                                recommendations for the future research agenda of the GBA field.</p>

                                            <p>Video games have assumed an important place in our daily lives. This
                                                has
                                                led to an increasing interest on the use of games for
                                                non-entertainment
                                                purposes, introducing the concept of Serious Games (SGs). In
                                                particular,
                                                SGs are being explored because of their potential to provide
                                                reliable
                                                assessments, but also because they can measure competences that
                                                would be
                                                difficult to measure using traditional forms of assessment. However,
                                                one
                                                of the key issues is that assessment machinery has to be designed
                                                specifically for each game, increasing the time and effort when
                                                designing and implementing Game-Based Assessments (GBAs). In this
                                                research, we introduce a novel approach to develop interoperable

                                                by: (1) designing and creating an ontology that can standardize the
                                                GBA
                                                area; (2) conducting a validation study on literature metrics to
                                                replicate them and designing novel metrics using data from different
                                                SGs; (3) conducting a case study that illustrates how our approach
                                                can
                                                be used in a real life scenario with real data. Our results confirm
                                                that
                                                the designed ontology can be used to effectively perform GBAs, along
                                                with the metrics replicated and designed in the system. We expect

                                            <p>During the last few years, there has been increasing attention paid
                                                to
                                                serious games (SGs), which are games used for non-entertainment
                                                purposes. SGs offer the potential for more valid and reliable
                                                assessments compared to traditional methods such as paper-and-pencil
                                                tests. However, the incorporation of assessment features into SGs is
                                                still in its early stages, requiring specific design efforts for
                                                each
                                                game and adding significant time to the design of Game-based
                                                Assessments
                                                (GBAs). In this research, we present a completely novel framework
                                                that
                                                aims to perform interoperable GBAs by: (a) integrating a common GBA
                                                ontology model to process RDF data; (b) developing in-game metrics
                                                to
                                                infer useful information and assess learners; (c) integrating a
                                                service
                                                API to provide an easy way to interact with the framework. We then
                                                validate our approach through performance evaluation and two use
                                                cases,
                                                demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios with
                                                large-scale
                                                datasets. Our results show that the developed framework achieves
                                                excellent performance, replicating metrics from previous literature.
                                                We
                                                anticipate that our work will help alleviate current limitations in
                                                the
                                                field and facilitate the deployment of GBAs as a Service.</p>

                                            <p>In recent years, serious games (SGs) have emerged as a powerful tool
                                                in
                                                education by combining pedagogy and entertainment, facilitating the
                                                acquisition of knowledge and skills in engaging environments. SGs
                                                enable
                                                the collection of valuable interaction data from students, allowing
                                                for
                                                the analysis of student performance, with artificial intelligence
                                                (AI)
                                                playing a key role in processing this data to make informed
                                                inferences
                                                about their knowledge and skills. However, the lack of
                                                explainability in
                                                AI models represents a significant challenge. This research aims to
                                                develop an interpretable model for predicting students' performance
                                                in
                                                real-time while playing an SG by: (1) calculating the performance of
                                                an
                                                interpretable prediction model of task completion in an SG and (2)
                                                demonstrating the application of the interpretable model for
                                                just-in-time (JIT) classroom interventions. Our results show that we
                                                are
                                                able to predict students' task completion in real-time with a
                                                balanced
                                                accuracy result of 77.21% after a short playtime has elapsed. In

                                            <p>In this research, we introduce a novel open-source labeling tool, the
                                                Game-Based Assessment (GBA) Labeling Tool, specifically designed to
                                                address current challenges for data labeling in GBA scenarios. This
                                                web-based application facilitates the annotation of audio, video,
                                                and
                                                game event data, offering three different types of annotations –
                                                global,
                                                time instant, and time window annotations – to enhance accuracy in
                                                the
                                                labeling process. The tool also offers customizable labels and
                                                various
                                                types of visualizations to support different contexts and scenarios.
